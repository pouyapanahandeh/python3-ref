#print function in python 3

print('This is an example of print function')

# you can use "" also

print("This is a function too")

# for skip ' we need backSlash like example

print('we are going to \' Airshow \' we will have fun')

# you can concat two string to each other 

print('I am pooya' + ' welcome to my github')

# you  can concat by just puthng , 

print('read the comment','do not move blindly')

# if you wanna have something like print('high'+ 5) we will get the error then the best way is using the built in function

print('High'+str(5)) # the str() is built in function to parse number to string
