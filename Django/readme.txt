Here we gonna build webApp base on python and Django.
I used Django version 1.9, you can install Django by following command:
pip install Django==1.9, in case you get permission error simply type:
sudo pip install Django==1.9.
in this project we use python 3.
also if you need to install pip first just google it.
Django is OS blind, it means it has a same structure on Different OS.
